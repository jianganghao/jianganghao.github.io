## Large Language Models and Responsible Use of AI (2023–present)

Since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, I initiated and led a team of scientists to explore the impact of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI on assessment and learning. This line of work includes:

- **ChatGPT detectors**: Led the development of a suite of machine-learning–based detectors for identifying AI-generated essays (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-3), leveraging text features, writing-process data, and essay similarity.
- **Responsible use of AI detectors**: Led a series of studies examining the responsible use of AI detectors and the development of general guidelines.
- **Impacts and implications of LLMs and GenAI on assessment**: Led a community effort involving researchers from ETS, Duolingo, NBME, Cambium, Boston College, and the University of Iowa to articulate implications for assessment.
- **EPCAL Audio Creator**: Led the development of tools leveraging LLMs and generative AI for audio creation, text translation, and automated coding.
- **EPCAL AI Coder**: Led the development of a platform using ChatGPT to automatically code communication data.
- **LLM Writing Evaluator**: Initiated and led a project comparing the quality of writing produced by LLMs.

## Assessment of Collaborative Problem Solving and 21st-Century Skills (2013–present)

I have led and co-led a sustained research program on the assessment of collaborative problem solving and 21st-century skills:

- **Collaborative Science Assessment Prototype (ECSAP)** (2013–2017): Led development of a collaborative problem-solving assessment prototype in science; selected by the NCES Commissioner as an example of future assessments at the White House (2014).  
  Paper: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ets2.12276
- **ETS Platform for Collaborative Assessment and Learning (EPCAL)** (2015–present): Led development of a platform supporting assessment and learning of human–human interaction (collaboration, communication, SEL). This core infrastructure has supported over 20 projects funded by ETS, NSF, IES, ARI, and other funding agencies.  
  Platform: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ets2.12181
- **ETS Platform for Collaborative Human Annotation (EPCHA)** (2020–present): Led development of a distributed platform for scalable human coding of communication data.
- **Collaborative Problem Solving Skills: Estimating Individual Contributions** (2019–2022): Co-PI on an Army Research Institute–funded project.
- **Improve learning and assessment through human–human interaction** (2020–present): Led an ETS-funded project on psychometric frameworks and scoring strategies.
- **Developing Middle Grade Students’ Social-Emotional Learning through Technology-Enhanced Collaborative Learning** (2024–2028): Co-PI on a U.S. Department of Education EIR-funded project.

## Data Analytics and AI for Test Security (2020–present)

Since 2020, I have led multiple data-driven projects funded by ETS Research Allocation and test security initiatives to advance analytics and AI methods for test security, particularly in remote testing contexts. These efforts contribute to over **60% of operational cheating detection**.

- **AutoESD (Automated Essay Similarity Detection)**: Identifies similar essays and presents them to human experts via an AI-assisted analytics dashboard.
- **AutoSSD (Automated Speech Similarity Detection)**: Detects similar speech responses and supports expert decision-making through an AI-assisted dashboard.
- **AI-Reviewer**: A machine-learning system integrating similarity features and expert adjudications to automate essay and speech similarity decisions.
- **Keystroke analytics and biometrics**: Tools for identifying imposters, copywriting behavior, and AI-generated essays.
- **Clickstream-based suspicious behavior detection**: Methods for identifying anomalous behaviors during the test-taking process.

## Core Data and Software Infrastructure for Game- and Simulation-Based Assessments (2014–2021)

I spearheaded a series of projects focused on analytics for telemetry and log data from game-based assessments and digital learning environments:

- **GlassPy: Game log analysis in Python** (2014–2019): Led the development of a Python package for analyzing game log data.  
  Paper: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ets2.12096  
  Presentation: https://youtu.be/pcWXjS830fo
- **Data model for virtual performance assessments and Evidence Trace File** (2014–2018): Led development of ETS’s data model for virtual performance assessments, proposing the Evidence Trace File and Evidence Identification–Centered Data Design (EICDD).  
  Paper: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ets2.12215
- **EPCAL analytics** (2019–2021): Led development of analytics dashboards for collaborative task data collected on the EPCAL platform.

## Astrophysics and Cosmology (2004–2013)

During my PhD and postdoctoral work at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, I conducted research in astrophysics and cosmology, including:

- Error-corrected Gaussian mixture models for red-sequence evolution
- GMBCG algorithm and large-scale optical galaxy-cluster catalogs
- Dark Energy Survey galaxy-cluster data management
- DECam focal-plane flatness measurement
- CCD image reduction and image-quality pipelines
