I am a research director at Educational Testing Service and lead the Assessment of Complex Skills program in the ets research institue. Curiosity is the fundamental driving force of all my research. Solving real-world problems using the most practical & effective methods, identifying & teaming up the right talents, and extracting evidence & insights from data to support decision making are the core themes of all my work. 

My current research centers on innovating EdTech, Data Science, Psychometrics, LLM and generative AI methods to measure people and their interactions. Some specific areas include Collaborative Problem Solving, Test Security in Remote Testing, and Game/Simulation-based Assessments. 

Before joining ETS, I worked on astrophysics and cosmology at Fermi National Accelerator Lab and the University of Michigan, where I worked on two prominent astronomical projects that have embraced big data since the early 2000s, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Survey (DES). In these projects, my research centered on developing unsupervised machine learning algorithms to detect galaxy clusters (my PhD project), CCD sensor, astronomical image processing, and cosmological parameter estimation.
