Suppose you have a code repository on GitHub (or GitLab), and you want to switch it to the other platform. To achieve this, you need to update the remote origin. Follow these steps:

### Switching the Remote Origin

1. **Check your current remote origin**:  
   Run the following command to see the current remote repository:  
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

2. **Remove the current remote origin**:   
   ```bash
   git remote remove origin
   ```

3. **Add the new remote origin**:  
   Replace the URL with the new repository's URL. For example:  
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://gitlab-token-name:token@gitlab.com/myuser/myrepo.git
   ```

4. **Set the main branch**:  
   Rename the current branch to `main` (if it's not already `main`):  
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   ```

5. **Push to the new remote**:  
   Push your code to the new repository:  
   ```bash
   git push -uf origin main
   ```

5. **If your repository has multiple branches and you want to push them all**:  
```bash
git push --all
```

### Git Branch Commands

1. **Check available branches**:  
   List all branches in the repository:  
   ```bash
   git branch -a
   ```

2. **Create and switch to a new branch**:  
   Create a new branch and switch to it:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-new-branch
   ```

3. **Switch between branches**:  
   Switch to an existing branch:  
   ```bash
   git switch new-branch
   ```
