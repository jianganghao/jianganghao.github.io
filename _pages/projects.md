## Large Language Models and Generative AI and their Responsible Use (2023–present)

Since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, I initiated and led a team of scientists to explore the impact of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI on assessment and learning. This line of work includes:

- **Automated coding using LLMs**: Led multiple projects that systematically evaluated LLM-based automated coding of AI-mediated communications (e.g., ChatGPT), demonstrating strong accuracy, reliability, and consistency across demographic subgroups.
- **Automated scoring of AI-assisted writing**: Led a comprehensive study of the characteristics of AI-generated and AI-assisted essays, identifying key limitations of existing automated scoring systems and proposing empirically grounded solutions.
- **ChatGPT detectors**: Led the development of a suite of machine-learning–based detectors for identifying AI-generated essays (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-3), leveraging text features, writing-process data, and essay similarity.
- **Responsible use of AI detectors**: Led a series of studies examining the responsible use of AI detectors and the development of general guidelines.
- **Impacts and implications of LLMs and GenAI on assessment**: Led a community effort involving researchers from ETS, Duolingo, NBME, Cambium, Boston College, and the University of Iowa to articulate implications for assessment.
- **EPCAL Audio Creator**: Led the development of tools leveraging LLMs and generative AI for audio creation, text translation, and automated coding.
- **EPCAL AI Coder**: Led the development of a platform using ChatGPT to automatically code communication data.
- **LLM Writing Evaluator**: Initiated and led a project comparing the quality of writing produced by LLMs.
